## Week 01 - Knowledge Summary

### Current knowledge

#### Computer Networking
The Internet is a computer networks that interconnects hundreds of millions of computing devices through the world. Today not only computers and workstation are being connected to the network, therefore Understanding of computer networking concepts including subnetting in IPv4, network topologies, and protocols such as TCP/IP. That the tools like Wireshark for network analysis and have configured network devices like routers and switches..


#### Internet
My knowledge of the Internet includes understanding that concept of  how web traffic is process routed over DNS and HTTP/HTTPS protocols. End systems access the Internet through Internet Service Providers (ISPs), including residential ISPs (cable or phone company), corporate, university ISPs .Each ISP in itself is a network of packet switches and communication links. Lower tier (which interconnect end-systems) ISPs are interconnected through national and international upper tier ISP. An upper-tier ISP consists of high speed routers interconnected with high-speed fiber-optic links. Each ISP network is managed independently


#### Cyber Security
I know that basic cybersecurity concepts like public key cryptography, firewalls, and encryption techniques mostly use techniques. I have used tools like NMap for network scanning and have some experienced with intrusion detection systems for proceesing,it
exhibits a new model of generating, using and providing ICT services, which
includes dynamically scalable virtual resources as services provided over the
Internet. In accordance with the prevailing trend government organizations are
increasingly moving critical IT infrastructure-related data to the cloud, which brings
about new cyber security challenges

#### Cloud Computing
Cloud computing is defined as the use of hosted services, such as data storage, servers, databases, networking, and software over the internet. I have practical experienced with AWS and also other cloud computing platforms. I configured my virtual machines, managed cloud storage process, and deployed applications on AWS for cloud computing.

### Equipment and technology
- Configuring a Cisco router for network routing.
- Set up a wireless access point (AP) in the home for Wi-Fi connection.
- Used Linux to find IP addresses and fix network configuration.
- Provide virtual machines in AWS cloud for application hosting.

### Educational sources
These skills were acquired through my IT degree, especially in these disciplines.
- Network initialization
- Internet technology
- Cyber ​​Security Basics
- cloud computing and virtualization
